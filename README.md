# WebScraping - Knowledge Graph

Create a knowledge graph: A simple ML Approach
https://github.com/cj2001/nodes2021_kg_workshop


Natural Language Processing (NLP)  + Graph Data Science Library + Basic ML

2 key concepts
1.	There is proverbial “silver bullet” with NLP
2.	The quality of what you get out of KG depends on the quality what you put it into

The Knowledge graph is useful for 
1.	Search
2.	Question answering
3.	Recommendation engine

The KG can be generated in different ways
1.	Co-occurrence
2.	Resource Description Framework (RDF) (by www)
3.	Subject Verb Object (SVO)

NLP Consideration for Knowledge graph creation
•	Named Entity recognition
•	SVO / SPO triples – verbs can be difficult to detect reliably using NLP
•	Very language dependent
•	Very topic – area dependent

Tools Used
•	Spacy
•	Wikipedia python package
•	Google Knowledge Graph
•	Pywikibot
•	Neo4j
o	Awesome procedures on cyber (APOC)
o	Graph Data Science (GDS) library
o	Cypher


Method  1: The NLP only Approach 




Adv: limitless verbs
Drawback: Entity disambiguation




Aura instances : There is no GDS library
